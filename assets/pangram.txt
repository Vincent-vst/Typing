The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz.
A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.
By Jove, my quick study of lexicography won a prize!
Waxy and quivering, jocks fumble the pizza.
